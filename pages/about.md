# About the Archive

The essential research question that this digital archive attempts to elucidate is: will the study of eighteenth-century primary sources (e.g. plays, poems, memoirs, etc.) referenced in the explanatory notes of Maria Edgeworth’s *Belinda* provide context as to how and why Edgeworth implemented these texts into her authorial aims (as a morally instructive work about virtue and the parameters of civility), so that a modern researcher/reader can better understand the social and cultural landscape in which the novel is embedded, to further facilitate new insights and a new perspective on how this work is powerfully evocative of formal realism (i.e. the literary mimicking facets of day-to-day life with profound likeness)?

My research question was based on my initial impressions and first reading of Belinda, during which I had the persistent feeling that certain aspects of the text functioned to provide foreshadowing, informative character comparisons/contrasts, and statements on virtue that would not be immediately legible to a modern reader due to our temporal removal from the contemporary literary landscape of the novel. My subsequent hypothesis was that this knowledge gap might be bridged by a closer evaluation of the eighteenth-century works that informed Edgeworth’s writing, as provided by the explanatory notes of the edition I read in class. I am delighted to say that countless discoveries about how effectively this work of fiction evoked a sense of formal realism resulted, and it is my hope that the interpretive field (comprised of my own scholarly conclusions in tandem with the existing information in the explanatory notes) provided for each entry might serve to reveal new/subtle facets of the novel to a modern researcher/reader in their introductory readings of the text.

The edition of Belinda central to this archival reconstruction was released in 2020 as part of the Oxford World’s Classics series, which is cited below:

This website was created as a final project for the course “Archives in Action,” and to provide further context for a close reading of eighteenth century literature as explored in another course, “Eighteenth-Century Prose Fiction.” The completion of this project is deeply indebted to the instruction and contributions of my professors, the Digital Scholarship team, and the libraries at Boston College.
