This reference is significant in that it seeks to highlight how this particular character (Sir Philip) is so prideful as to cloud his good judgment (sense). Over the course of the novel the reader observes how this foible is sustained in his efforts to court Belinda at the expense of Clarence's clear feelings for her and her own lack of response to his suit.",Alexander Pope,"This excerpt can be found in Epistle 2, lines 283-296--or page 37-38 in the document.",1733,1733-1734,Poetry,,,
23,shenstone.jpeg,Works in Verse and Prose,image/jpeg,"This slight misquotation might be considered a form of foreshadowing, as those who are well-read in Edgeworth's formulation tends to be evocative of highly sensible and moral individuals. Here the reader gets a signifier of her future reformation, in part inspired by Clarence Hervey. The original text reads: ""Why mourns my friend! why weep his downcast eye? / That eye where mirth, where fancy us'd to shine?""",William Shenstone,"This excerpt can be found in the first lines of Elegy 26, page 74 of the document.",1764,1764,Poetry,,,
24,iliad.jpeg,Iliad,image/jpeg,"Likely a reference to the lines: ""Persuasive Speech, and more Persuasive Sighs, / Silence that spoke, and Eloquence of Eyes."" Much of Hervey's appeal within the novel is situated in his easy capacity to match wits with Lady Delacour, but even more so in that his riffs have their locus in their intellectual and good-natured profundity. Ultimately the novel posits a morality/sensibility less concerned with the vanity considered inherent in this kind of social performance, but he is lauded for the sheer scope of his intellect all the same.",Homer; Alexander Pope,"This excerpt can be found in book 14, lines 251-252--page 104 of volume 4.",1715,1715-1720,Epic,,,
25,penseroso.jpeg,Il Penseroso',image/jpeg,"An allusion to Il Penseroso's address to the Muse of tragedy: ""They rapt soul sitting in thine eyes; / There held in holy passion still, / Forget thyself to marble."" This may be a a clever remark on the latent strength of feeling within Belinda, in that though she freezes in the face of Hervey's circle of friends making unflattering remarks about her aunt, later on Lady Delacour attempts to comfort her when she cries from her initial distress.",John Milton,"This excerpt can be found in lines 40-42, page 14 of the document linked.",1751,1751,Poetry,,,
26,fortune.jpeg,The Wheel of Fortune,image/jpeg,"While it is still early within the text, this is again a testament to Lady Delacour's latent morality, in that (unlike Mrs. Freke) she may be suggesting she would never expect Belinda to be with anyone she sincerely doesn't like. As the passage cited here is with reference to Emily in the play, who remarks ""No sir that would be to debar me from the use of eyes, ears, and understanding"" when her father says he would not expect her to prefer a marriage to an unwelcome suitor in comparison to the man she loves.",Richard Cumberland,"This excerpt is from Act 4 of this comedy, which can be found on page 53.",1795,1795,Play,,,
27,belle.jpeg,The Belle's Stratagem,image/jpeg,"What is of particular note here is that the exchange alluded to in this play is likely that of Lady Frances asking ""Why do you keep on your mask?"" and Courtall replying after saying they have no time for the niceties of bidding everyone goodbye to ""'Put on your mask, I have a particular reason for it.'"" While this can easily be read as Lady Delacour advising Belinda ""not to let her real feelings show"" (464), an additional reading may be that a great deal of Lady Delacour's character construction has its basis in a self-imposed need to wittily perform in order to maintain her reputation and thrive within her social circumstances. Much of her reformation as a character is her removal from this somewhat vain fixation to a focus on cultivating a greater, more sincere amity with her husband and daughter.",Hannah Cowley,"This excerpt is from Act IV of this play, and can be found on page 55.",1780,1780,Play,,,
28,henry8.jpeg,Henry VIII,image/jpeg,"In this passage Lady Delacour mirrors Cardinal Wolsey's words: ""Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal / I serv'd my king, he would not mine age / Have left me naked to mine enemies."" There are many points of significance in this juxtaposition, not the least of which aligning personal morality with serving God; in some ways, suggesting that the very highest order of conduct is reaching toward the highest order of being. There is also the more surface level consideration that vanity is being portrayed as a vice, and one which may lead to personal ruin or dissolution if left unchecked for a lifetime. What is of particular note in a second reading of the text as well is the part about being left vulnerable to enemies, in that Mrs. Freke rather cruelly capitalizes on this weakness within Lady Delacour (and within other characters as well).",William Shakespeare,"This excerpt is from Act 3, scene two of this play, which can be found on page 65 of this document. During this period, Henry VIII was incredibly popular among Shakespeare's plays.",1732,1732,Play,,,
29,memoirsrle.jpeg,Memoirs,image/jpeg,"It is well known that Lady Delacour's character was closely aligned with the real life figure of Sir Francis Delaval, taken almost verbatim from Edgeworth's father's biography of Delaval's life. Unlike Delaval's unfortunate portend of his own life's end two days later, Lady Delacour is afforded the chance to change and live in a fulfilling way--which is a testament to what might be lost in the somewhat wooden and didactic morality within the text; ultimately this is a story in which people can achieve the same, so long as they understand their own potential and overcome their vices.",Richard Lovell Edgeworth,Lady Delacour's lament is mirrored in an account of Delaval's remarks to her Edgeworth's father on pages 155-156.,1820,1820,Memoir/Biography,,,
30,adele.jpeg,Adele et Theodore: ou lettres sur l'education,image/jpeg,"Maria Edgeworth translated the first volume of these letters from the original French, of which Lady Delacour's remark may be alluding to the following: ""il est vrai qu'il possèdent au suprême degré l'eloquence du billet"" from Letter 10. The English translation of which was: ""Many women are very clever in the art of writing notes, and express themselves with great eloquence."" This, in line with Lady Delacour's thematic vanity--especially relied upon in strenuous moments--may be seen as an extension of that facet of her character. There is however an even more noticeable alignment beyond this direct mirroring, in that the beginning of the letter begins with the writer's lament of her own fixation with being a coquette, and the time she wasted in trying to emulate this self-same vanity--exactly like Lady Delacour's regret a handful of pages before: ""What a picture you have sent me of coquetry; it will cure me of all pretensions to it! I shall never again boast of being a coquette, and I shall all my life repent ever having had the appearance of one! You have really made a deep impression on me, but why did you not tell me all this when I was but twenty years old? My reformation would then have done you more honour, and would have spared me much pain.""",Madame de Genlis,"This excerpt is from Letter 10, pages 41-42 as well as 35-36, entitled Viscountess to the Baroness; this series of correspondence was translated into English entitled Adelaide and Theodore in 3 volumes in 1783.",1782,1782,Correspondence,,,
31,lock.jpeg,The Rape of the Lock,image/jpeg,"Lady Delacour refers to the moment Belinda wakes up in Pope's poem--""First, rob'd in white, the Nymph intent adores / With Head uncover'd the Cosmetic Pow'rs'--but is perhaps also alluding to the fact that Belinda does not adorn herself with copious amounts of make-up or jewelry, unlike the Belinda of that scene. By contrast, Lady Delacour's finery in terms of her garments as well as her known tendency to wear a great deal of make-up is consistently remarked upon within the text--likely another statement on the inherent vice of that kind of excessive vanity. Lady Anne Percival is likewise rarely addressed in terms of her appearance (like Belinda), but rather in the joy and comfort she inspires in the people around her.",Alexander Pope,"This excerpt is from Canto I, Lines 123-124, which can be found on page 16 of the document.",1714,1714,Poetry,,,
32,inchbald.jpeg,A Simple Story,image/jpeg,"Here, Lady Delacour does not give her full name--and indeed the reader does not ever get full clarification as to her name beyond her title. This operates on two levels: the first, and perhaps most surface level reading, is to acknowledge that it is part of the mystique that she endeavors to cultivate as a coquette. The second, is that in her vanity to maintain appearances in some ways she does cease to be a person and becomes instead something of stand-in for the 'reformed rake' stock type. She serves a particular purpose within the novel, as a cautionary tale within Edgeworth's moral framing. Edgeworth may have received inspiration from Miss Milner in this referenced work, of which she was particularly fond. ",Elizabeth Inchbald,,1791,1791,Novel,,,

This is a reference to the lines: ""Sad was the Hour, and luckless was the Day, / When first from Shiraz' Walls I bent my Way."" Hassan, the titular character, is seen here lamenting the intensity of the desert's trials on the body, and perhaps too Lady Delacour seeks to speak of all the ways her marriage has lead her into a serious of trials and tribulations with regard to money, specifically.",William Collins,"Excerpt found within the second ecologue, ot 'Hassan, or the Camel Driver.'",1742,1742,Story Collection,,,
39,caesar.jpeg,Julius Caesar,image/jpeg,"Likely with reference to Brutus' lines: ""I can raise no money by vile means / By heaven, I had rather coin my heart / And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring / From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash / By any indirection."" Particularly interesting in that here Brutus is lambasting Cassius for the money owed to him--and in some ways may be a reflection of Lady Delacour's displeasure with her husband and his lawyer's spending her fortune without caution. However, the end of the scene features a kind of reconiliation between the two and an acknowledgement of faults made, so this may be foreshadowing their martial recovery.",William Shakespeare,"This is an excerpt from Act 4 Scene 3. The earliest edition by which I could find the lines referenced from Brutus was 1766, all editions prior do not have a clearly delineated scene 3 or appear to contain these spoken lines.",1711,1711,Play,,,
40,ted.jpeg,Thoughts on the Education of Daughters,image/jpeg,"Wollstonecraft early on in this text advocates for a closer bond between mother and child in child-rearing, particularly with regard to breast-feeding infants instead of handing them off to wet-nurses: ""The mother (if there are not very weighty reasons to prevent her) ought to suckle her children"". Lady Delacour shows some contempt for this practice, but there is reason to believe that it has more to do with unresolved grief with the death of her first child than necessarily an oppositional alignment with Wollstonecraft. Her inability to socially engage with other women on this level and enjoy what was considered the height of domestic happiness (in Edgeworth's view, the nuclear family unit especially) was likely highlighted here.",Mary Wollstonecraft,"Pages 3-4 detail Wollstonecraft's commitment to the practice as mentioned in the passage. Of particular note is the fact that modern science has confirmed the veracity of improved health and bonding through this practice, and its contribution to preventing disease or harm from neglect.",1787,1787,,,,
41,olney.jpeg,Olney Hymns,image/jpeg,"Central to Lady Delacour's narrative function as a reformed rake and Maria Edgeworth's larger literary aim of writing a moral tale, here she details the ways in which her lack of a developed home life with her husband and child resulted in her focus on vanity and social attention. A stanza in the hymn referenced includes the lines: ""What peaceful hours I once enjoy'd! / How sweet their mem'ry still! / But they have left an aching void, / The world can never fill.'"" Edgeworth may be further implying here that fulfillment cannot be achieved for a woman without the joys of a peaceful married life cultivated in virtue, and that this self-same void cannot be filled by any form of vice such as vanity or a reliance on alcohol as featured in Lord Delacour.",William Cowper,"With reference to the first hymn featured in this collection, called: 'O! for a closer walk with God!', and can be found on page 4.",1779,1779,Hymn,,,
42,delicacy.jpeg,False Delicacy,image/jpeg,,Hugh Kelly,Comic play,1768,1768,Play,,,
43,toalady.jpeg,To a Lady',image/jpeg,"A reference to Pope's description of Calypso: ""'Twas thus Calypso once our hearts alarm'd, / Aw'd without virtue, without Beauty charm'd / Her Tongue bewitch'd as oddly as her Eyes, / Less Wit than Mimic, more a Wit than Wife, / Strange Graces still, and stranger Flights she had, / Was just not ugly, and was just not mad; / Yet never so sure our passion to create, / As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate."" There are several points of intrigue here, each of which foreshadowing a great deal of Mrs. Freke's chracterization. From her erratic and haphazardous behavior, to the intentional way that she capitalizes upon the weakness of others. For example, how she uses Juba's superstitious nature against him as well as attempts to persuade Belinda against the virtue inherent in the Percivals' lifestyle--reducing it to boring worthlessness. Much of her ability to deceive Lady Delacour was in her deliberate manipulation of the former's vanity and desperation for social belonging. Calypso as a figure herself is also an evocative extrapolation, in that the name itself means to ""conceal,"" and the reader discovers just how much Mrs. Freke conceals from both Lady Delacour and others in general: her initial introduction into the text was the deliberate prank played on Hervey regarding who was dressed as the widow Brady. Furthermore, Mrs. Freke hides the way in which she leads Colonel Lawless to believe Lady Delacour wanted to separate from lord Delacour and be his lover instead, resulting in the calamitous duel for her honor. The particular line ""less wit than mimic"" is also rather powerful here, in that Mrs. Freke turns out to be unable to hold her own against Sir Percival in a debate about the inherent value of virtue, signalling the fact that she is more prone to copy fallacious, surface level arguments without a real substantive justification to add to the debate.",Alexander Pope,Lines 49-52,1735,1735,Correspondence,,,
44,vicar.jpeg,The Vicar of Wakefield,image/jpeg,"With direct reference to Ephraim Jenkinson, who intentionally deceives his audience that he is a learned man via his repeated explication of cosmogony. While Lady Delacour speaks ill of Lord Delacour here, there is a contradictory element to this comparison; in that Lord Delacour turns out to be right about how negative an influence Mrs. Freke was on both of their honor as a result of entangling Colonel Lawless into their affairs.",Oliver Goldsmith,"2 vols, vol 1 ch.14 and vol 2 ch 4",1766,1766,Novel,,,
45,hamlet.jpeg,Hamlet,image/jpeg,"With reference to Hamlet's lines: ""O! it offends me to the Soul, to hear a robustous Perriweg pated Fellow tear a Passion to very Rags, to split the Ears of the Groundlings; who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb Shews and Noise: I would have such a Fellow whipp'd for o'er doing it Termagant; it out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it."" Here he is advising the player not to overdo his acting, and in much the same way Lady Delacour means to imply that Mrs. Freke took the mockery of her concerns to a whole new level.",William Shakespeare,"This excerpt can be found in Act Three, scene two, and can be found on page 46.",1757,1757,Play,,,
46,caesar.jpeg,Julius Caesar,image/jpeg,"Here Lady Delacour references Cassius' famous phrase: ""Men at some times are Master of their Fates: The Fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in our selves, that we are Underlings."" Of interest here is the preface to this line, in that Lady Delacour's reformation is central to her character--and is something that she chooses for herself with the help of Belinda, in the aftermath of Mrs. Freke's betrayal and the exacerbation of her chest wound. Much of Lady Delcaour's dissolution is something that she perceives as inevitable too, although there are aspects of it that were exacerbated by both her and her husband's vices. Furthermore, here Cassius can be seen as taking on something of Mrs. Freke's aim, in that he tries to bolster Brutus as equal to Caesar, which is mirrored in Mrs. Freke's elevation of Lady Delacour leading to the death of another man.",William Shakespeare,"This excerpt is from Act 1, scene 2, and can be found on page 10 of this document.",1711,1711,Play,,,
