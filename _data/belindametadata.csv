This reference is significant in that it seeks to highlight how this particular character (Sir Philip) is so prideful as to cloud his good judgment (sense).

Much of Hervey's appeal within the novel is situated in his easy capacity to match wits with Lady Delacour, but even more so in that his riffs have their locus in their intellectual and good-natured profundity.

While this can easily be read as Lady Delacour advising Belinda ""not to let her real feelings show"" (464), an additional reading may be that a great deal of Lady Delacour's character construction has its basis in a self-imposed need to wittily perform in order to maintain her reputation and thrive within her social circumstances. Much of her reformation as a character is her removal from this somewhat vain fixation to a focus on cultivating a greater, more sincere amity with her husband and daughter.","This excerpt is from Act IV of this play, and can be found on page 55.",Play,28,image/jpeg,henry8.jpeg,Henry VIII,William Shakespeare,1732,1732,28,"""'If I had served myself, with half the zeal that I have served the world, I should not now be thus forsaken!

There are many points of significance in this juxtaposition, not the least of which aligning personal morality with serving God; in some ways, suggesting that the very highest order of conduct is reaching toward the highest order of being. There is also the more surface level consideration that vanity is being portrayed as a vice, and one which may lead to personal ruin or dissolution if left unchecked for a lifetime. What is of particular note in a second reading of the text as well is the part about being left vulnerable to enemies, in that Mrs. Freke rather cruelly capitalizes on this weakness within Lady Delacour (and within other characters as well).","This excerpt is from Act 3, scene two of this play, which can be found on page 65 of this document.

Unlike Delaval's unfortunate portend of his own life's end two days later, Lady Delacour is afforded the chance to change and live in a fulfilling way--which is a testament to what might be lost in the somewhat wooden and didactic morality within the text; ultimately this is a story in which people can achieve the same, so long as they understand their own potential and overcome their vices.",Lady Delacour's lament is mirrored in an account of Delaval's remarks to her Edgeworth's father on pages 155-156.,Memoir/Biography,30,image/jpeg,adele.jpeg,Adele et Theodore: ou lettres sur l'education,Madame de Genlis,1782,1782,32,"""'will you dine with me têtê-à-têtê, and I'll write an excuse, alias a lie, to lady Singleton, in the form of a charming note.

The English translation of which was: ""Many women are very clever in the art of writing notes, and express themselves with great eloquence."" This, in line with Lady Delacour's thematic vanity--especially relied upon in strenuous moments--may be seen as an extension of that facet of her character. There is however an even more noticeable alignment beyond this direct mirroring, in that the beginning of the letter begins with the writer's lament of her own fixation with being a coquette, and the time she wasted in trying to emulate this self-same vanity--exactly like Lady Delacour's regret a handful of pages before: ""What a picture you have sent me of coquetry; it will cure me of all pretensions to it! I shall never again boast of being a coquette, and I shall all my life repent ever having had the appearance of one!

By contrast, Lady Delacour's finery in terms of her garments as well as her known tendency to wear a great deal of make-up is consistently remarked upon within the text--likely another statement on the inherent vice of that kind of excessive vanity.

The second, is that in her vanity to maintain appearances in some ways she does cease to be a person and becomes instead something of stand-in for the 'reformed rake' stock type.

Particularly interesting in that here Brutus is lambasting Cassius for the money owed to him--and in some ways may be a reflection of Lady Delacour's displeasure with her husband and his lawyer's spending her fortune without caution. However, the end of the scene features a kind of reconiliation between the two and an acknowledgement of faults made, so this may be foreshadowing their martial recovery.","This is an excerpt from Act 4 Scene 3.

Lady Delacour shows some contempt for this practice, but there is reason to believe that it has more to do with unresolved grief with the death of her first child than necessarily an oppositional alignment with Wollstonecraft. Her inability to socially engage with other women on this level and enjoy what was considered the height of domestic happiness (in Edgeworth's view, the nuclear family unit especially) was likely highlighted here.","Pages 3-4 detail Wollstonecraft's commitment to the practice as mentioned in the passage.

There are several points of intrigue here, each of which foreshadowing a great deal of Mrs. Freke's chracterization. From her erratic and haphazardous behavior, to the intentional way that she capitalizes upon the weakness of others. For example, how she uses Juba's superstitious nature against him as well as attempts to persuade Belinda against the virtue inherent in the Percivals' lifestyle--reducing it to boring worthlessness. Much of her ability to deceive Lady Delacour was in her deliberate manipulation of the former's vanity and desperation for social belonging. Calypso as a figure herself is also an evocative extrapolation, in that the name itself means to ""conceal,"" and the reader discovers just how much Mrs. Freke conceals from both Lady Delacour and others in general: her initial introduction into the text was the deliberate prank played on Hervey regarding who was dressed as the widow Brady. Furthermore, Mrs. Freke hides the way in which she leads Colonel Lawless to believe Lady Delacour wanted to separate from lord Delacour and be his lover instead, resulting in the calamitous duel for her honor. The particular line ""less wit than mimic"" is also rather powerful here, in that Mrs. Freke turns out to be unable to hold her own against Sir Percival in a debate about the inherent value of virtue, signalling the fact that she is more prone to copy fallacious, surface level arguments without a real substantive justification to add to the debate.",Lines 49-52,Correspondence,44,image/jpeg,vicar.jpeg,The Vicar of Wakefield,Oliver Goldsmith,1766,1766,41,"""'The league of amity between [Lady Delacour and Mrs. Freke] was scarcely ratified, before my lord Delacour came with his wise remonstrating face, to beg me 'to consider what was due to my honor and his.'--Like the cosmogony-man in the Vicar of Wakefield, he came out over and over with this cant phrase, which had once stood him in stead.'""",https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99110887330001021,"With direct reference to Ephraim Jenkinson, who intentionally deceives his audience that he is a learned man via his repeated explication of cosmogony.

Much of Lady Delcaour's dissolution is something that she perceives as inevitable too, although there are aspects of it that were exacerbated by both her and her husband's vices.
