Also of note, that in Lyttleton's poem he does distinguish his deceased wife Lucy's charms as being specifically virtuous and distinctly English (as compared to Italy and France), so there is something to be said regarding Edgeworth's larger claims of the height of civility and its association with English culture superceding that of other nations.",Lord George Lyttleton,"This excerpt can be found in part XII, at the bottom page nine of the primary source document.",1747,1747,Poetry,Domestic Life; Matrimony; Moral,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99118070440001021,Lord George Lyttleton,1,"Preface: ""A prudence undeceiving, undeceived, / That nor too little, nor too much believed; / That scorned unjust Suspicion's coward fear, / and without weakness knew to be sincere",,
2,moraltales.jpeg,Contes Moraux (Moral Tales),image/jpeg,"Originally a writer for comedy, Marmontel began this series with some initial essays written with fallacious, overdetermined foundational premises, each different but based in contemporary social observations or sayings that were often taken for granted. Over time, these amassed into a large collection of instructive tales, in which he complicated the initial impressions/assumptions people make through the lives of each character drawn. Edgeworth makes numerous and explicit references to this story collection, and it can be seen in a sizable influence to her writing style, where it can sometimes approach a didactic element; however, she also does take up a similar project of plumbing the depths of social questions and constructing characters that do the work of demanding a more nuanced evaluation of things like London society life, marriage, and perspectives on the globalized world (France, the West Indies, etc).",Jean-Francois Marmontel,The link provided offers a digitized copy of the primary source.,1764,1764-1766,Story Collection,Literary Culture; Moral; Translation; Comedy; Global Literature,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99119034500001021,Maria Edgeworth,3,"""The following work is offered to the public as a Moral Tale--the author not wishing to acknowledge a Novel.""",,

There is reasonable speculation that Edgeworth conceived of the novel's character Belinda based on two examples of poems about genteel young women named Belinda and courtship: The Rape of the Lock, by Alexander Pope, and this work by Lyttleton. Additionally, Belinda's last name ""Portman"" might suggest ""portmeanteau""--in other words, a collection of her qualities and attractions, as outlined by this poem (459).",Lord George Lyttleton,The link provided offers a digitized copy of the primary source.,1733,1733,Poetry,Contemporary Works; Literary Culture; Moral,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99119470140001021,Narrator,7,"""One niece still remained unmarried--Belinda Portman, of whom she was determined to get rid of with all convenient expedition.""",,
12,advicetolady.jpeg,Advice to a Lady,image/jpeg,"Mrs. Stanhope invokes a line within this poem, which at large endeavors to speak the ""truth"" about the nature and origins of feminine vanity, and how it is counterproductive to the cultivation of a honest and sensible (in line with the contemporary definition, prudent) love in women: “What is your Sex’s earliest, latest Care, / Your Heart’s supreme Ambition? To be fair; / For this the Toilet every Thought employs, / Hence all the Toils of Dress, and all the Joys : / For this Hands, Lips, and Eyes are put to School, / And each instructed Feature has its Rule.” Mrs. Stanhope attempts to inculcate within her nieces an aspect of this mindset; in which every quality/talent/asset of the person is marsheled to establish themselves in high society--more specifically, to marry a wealthy man of considerable status--just as it is represented here in the service of vain attraction. This is contradictory to Lyttleton's overall message about how women are raised to be captivating on a surface level, rather than expressing beauty as something that comes from within: “Her fairest Virtues fly from publick Sight, / Domestick Worth, that shuns too strong a Light...Thus, I, Belinda, would your Charms improve, / And form your Heart to all the Arts of Love.” The foreshadowing inherent in this allusion by Edgeworth signals the true nature of the novel's narrative aims, which is to create a heroine of the same name who wins her romantic love match through bold prudence and humility--not through the excessive vanity and wit of fashion witnessed in Lady Delacour. This also gives considerable insight into Mrs.Stanhope's mind, in that she believes it is exactly this aspect of Lady Delacour that will be an asset to Belinda's social advancement, revealing her short-sighted and ultimately poor advice when it comes to choosing a partner solely on the basis of immediate financial gain.",Lord George Lyttleton,"The phrases referenced can be found on page 4 of the primary source document, spanning lines 21-22.",1733,1733,Poetry,Contemporary Works; Literary Culture; Moral,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99119470140001021,Narrator,7,"""'For this, hands, lips, and eyes were put to school, / And each instructed feature had it's rule.'""",,

Clarence then goes on to describe his haunting recollection, rendered by the novel's Clarence as a way to convey the displeasure with which he felt his visit at Mrs.Luttridge's house. The comparison is apt, considering Mrs.Luttridge is proven to be every bit as calculating and ruthless as Richard III; revealed especially in the chapter regarding her E O table, which she uses to swindle countless high society men out of enormous sums of money.",William Shakespeare,"With reference to Act 1, scene 4, which begins at the bottom of page 23 and continues on to page 25.",1734,1734,Play,Theater; Literary Culture; History; Tragedy,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99119452890001021,Lady Delacour; Clarence Hervey,13,"""'What was your dream, my lord, I pray you tell me?'""

In the primary source, the speaker conveys a sincere wish to behold the goddess Melancholy in all of her majesty, and in this section speaks of staying up all night for just a glimpse of her passing. Marriott's insistent association of tragedy with Lady Delacour--whose sole aspiration in life is to disguise the extent of her true feelings of unhappiness and illness from the world, yet unknown to the reader--as well as Lady Delacour's subsequent allusion could be considered an adroit form of foreshadowing on Edgeworth's part. Marriott, as her waiting-woman, would be one of the people closest to Lady Delacour, and so her ability to reveal things that are not evident to the social world (which is how Mrs. Stanhope understands and communicates Lady Delacour's sensibility to Belinda) is significant.",John Milton,The phrase referenced by Lady Delacour can be found at the top of page 19 in the primary source document.,1751,1751,Poetry,Literary Culture; Ode,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99106892090001021,Lady Delacour,19,"""O yes, you [Belinda] must be the comic muse; and I [Lady Delacour] must be tragedy, because Marriott has a passion for seeing me 'come sweeping by.'""",,

What is of particular note in this section of the play is the way in which her descriptions are progressively inverted here, and the content of her replies to Parolles seems to be intentionally trying to distract him from the true nature of her feelings by remaining vague and contradictory. Bertram, much like Lady Delacour, is a rather willful person of significant power; he rejects Helen's romantic feelings for him several times on the basis of her class before he can be convinced to be with her by the end of the play. Belinda here, in all of her shrewd perception, notices that it is not Lady Delacour simply indulging Marriott's demands--which would not be entirely unexpected from her penchant for raillery, despite being willful by nature--but rather that she is obeying Marriott for some other reason.",William Shakespeare,"The line ""proud humility"" can be found in Act 1, scene 1, on page 9 of the primary source document.",1756,1756,Play,Theater; Literary Culture; Comedy,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99122107240001021,Belinda,19,"""For some time, Belinda imagined that this submission was merely an air, as she had seen some other fine ladies proud of appearing to be governed by a favourite maid; but she soon was convinced, that Marriott was no favourite with lady Delacour; that her ladyship's was not proud humility, but fear.""",,

One would be remiss to not to notice the way both Harriot Freke and Lady Delacour, in their imitation of the character, are being exemplified as fashionable members of London high society. As this precedent is also set to establish the reader's understanding/expectations of Harriot Freke, it is apt that the main character does act outrageously and later dresses as a man to ward off an unwanted suitor. Harriot Freke does all of these things, but instead of trying to chase unwanted affections away in a comedic way, she implements these qualities for the sake of maintaining constant social relevance and manipulating other vain individuals vulnerable to her machinations.",David Garrick,The link provided offers a digitized copy of the primary source.,1772,1772,Play,Theater; Contemporary Works; Comedy,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99110468160001021,Lady Delacour,20,"""Harriot Freke has told him, in confidence, that I'm to be the widow Brady, in man's clothes; now that's to be Harriot's own character, so Hervey will make fine confusion.""",,

There are two notable impilcations to this description of his failed serpent costume for the masquerade; the first and most obvious one being that he is being aligned with all of the virtues and appeal of Adam rather than Lucifer in the form of the snake. His costume fails literally and symbolically because he does not have the capacity to be maliciously manipulative or deceptive to the extent witnessed in Lucifer, even despite his capacity for social adaptation. The added observation that ""nothing remained but the melancholy spectacle of [the serpent's] skeleton"" further implies that Clarence's adherence to vanity is entirely mechanical, not the driving force of his mind and personality like Harriot Freke (21).

Unlike Delaval's unfortunate portend of his own life's end two days later, Lady Delacour is afforded the chance to change and live in a fulfilling way--which is a testament to what might be lost in the sometimes wooden and didactic sense of morality within the text; ultimately this is a story in which people can achieve the same, so long as they understand their own potential and overcome their vices (often with the support of others and/or supplemental reading).",Richard Lovell Edgeworth,Lady Delacour's lament is mirrored in an account of Delaval's remarks to Edgeworth's father on pages 155-156 of the primary source document.,1820,1820,Memoir; Biography,Current Events; Moral,https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038693530,Lady Delacour,28,"""'I have sacrificed reputation, happiness--every thing to the love of frolic--All frolic will soon be at an end with me--I am dying--and I shall die unlamented by any human being.

This in line with Lady Delacour's thematic vanity--especially relied upon in strenuous moments--may be seen as an extension of this facet of her character. There is, however, an even more noticeable alignment beyond this direct mirroring, in that the beginning of the letter starts with the writer's lament of her own fixation with being a coquette, and the time she wasted in trying to emulate this self-same vanity--exactly like Lady Delacour's regret a handful of pages before: ""What a picture you have sent me of coquetry; it will cure me of all pretensions to it!

For example, how she uses Juba's superstitious nature against him as well as attempts to persuade Belinda against the virtue inherent in the Percivals' lifestyle--reducing it to boring worthlessness. Much of her ability to deceive Lady Delacour was in her deliberate manipulation of the former's vanity and desperation for social belonging. Calypso as a figure herself is also an evocative extrapolation, in that the name itself means to ""conceal,"" and the reader discovers just how much Mrs. Freke conceals from both Lady Delacour and others in general: her initial introduction into the text was the deliberate prank played on Hervey regarding who was dressed as the widow Brady. Furthermore, Mrs. Freke hides the way in which she leads Colonel Lawless to believe Lady Delacour wanted to separate from Lord Delacour and be his lover instead, resulting in the calamitous duel for her honor. The particular line ""less wit than mimic"" is also rather powerful here, in that Mrs. Freke turns out to be unable to hold her own against Sir Percival in a debate about the inherent value of virtue, signalling the fact that she is more prone to copy fallacious, surface level arguments without a real substantive justification to add to any serious discussion about what constitutes virtue.",Alexander Pope,"The relevant lines in this poem span 45-52, and can be found on page 8.",1735,1735,Poetry,Contemporary Works; Literary Culture; Moral,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99118085650001021,Lady Delacour,41,"""'[Mrs.Freke] had the talent of making the world believe that virtue to be invulnerable by nature, which disdained the common outworks of art for it's defence.

While this surface level interpretation does prove contradictory to Lady Delacour's argument in the context of that moment in the novel, this evocation of the primary source can be said to operate on two levels. First, revealing Lady Delacour's future capacity for reformation--in that she is capable of seeing what is valuable about moral texts, but inevitably applies them incorrectly or misattributes them--confused by her own vanity. The precise passage cited in Moore's fable is the following: “When Celia struts in man’s attire, / She shews too much to raise desire, / But from the hoop’s bewitching round, / Her very shoe has the pow’r to wound.” While there is a clear emphasis on the importance of modesty, there is also mention of how men's attire is unfavorable on women due to its revealing nature. This is particularly interesting with regard to several characters that costume themselves in either hoops instead of men's attire (Clarence) or men's attire instead of hoops (Harriot Freke). One can extrapolate that, Clarence's ability to disguise himself convincingly in a hoop may speak to his capacity for modesty despite his playful social banter with Lady Delacour, which is proven true towards the end of the novel. Furthermore, Harriot Freke is unbecoming in men's attire because of her self-serving vanity on unremitting display when she is costumed that way; she is revealed to be lacking in simplicity or modesty. In Lady Delacour's apt words, men's attire reveals her to be a woman without honor (the way an honorable woman was understood in this particular time). While it is a minute detail, one can also how Clarence embodies the bee at the end of the fable, in that he deems Mrs. Stanhope and her nieces to be the calculating spider seeking to ensnare him into marriage on false pretenses in order to take advantage of his fortune and social standing.

One may note, however, that this play was a tragedy; but the circumstances that drive the lovers apart are based in religious differences and jealousy, not necessarily a lack of compatibilty or happiness. Clarence later proves impervious to jealousy in his focus on ensuring Belinda's happiness--even if it cannot be shared with him--and they are both compatible in terms of class and cultural origin, which in some ways is suggested to be part of the reason Mr.Vincent's engagement to Belinda is dissolved.

While this serves to highlight Lady Delacour's penchant for raillery (in the satirical spirit of the times), it was likely also a comment on the fact that hoops were by 1800 fashionably obsolete, but necessary for proper court appearances. The performativity of this aspect of feminine life was considerable, given the difficulty hoops posed to walking despite aesthetic appeal.

More time proves that Belinda likely feels a great deal for Clarence, which Lady Delacour discovers and draws out over the final chapters of the novel.

Of note also is that the message Iris delivers is not one of poor tidings and speaks of Zeus' desire to guide them through unharmed, and in this way one might also perceive the parallel of Lady Delacour's earnest wish to bring them together, and that her designs to communicate on each other’s behalf are benevolent as proven by the end of the novel.",Homer; Alexander Pope,"The section of the Iliad Lady Delacour refers to here is in Book 24, likely with reference to Iris message to King Priam starting on line 207-225, spanning pages 154-155 in the primary source document.",1715,1715-1720,Poetry,Contemporary Works; Literary Culture; Translation; Epic; Global Literature; Classics,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99123604190001021,Lady Delacour,71,"""'Stay,' interrupted lady Delacour, 'let me get it by heart--I should have made a terrible bad messenger of the gods and goddesses, for I never in my life could, like Iris, repeat a message in the same words in which it was delivered to me.--Let me see--""Dignity of mind, and simplicity of character,"" was not it?'""",,

Inherent in Clarence's reply to Lady Delacour is that perhaps he does perceive Belinda to be an angel in all of the benevolent and romantic implications of that word, but his fear is that any hastened remark of passion will be received as a sign of surface level or insincere flattery. Lady Delacour instantly perceives the depth of his feelings in this cautious approach, and this moment serves as one of the subtle but numerous instances in which Clarence's regard for Belinda is revealed between the lines.

Pope's conviction here is that regardless of what anyone might say, the truth of Cobham's dedication to the preservation of his country will always win out. This allusion might be a subtle comment on the fact of Lady Delacour's emergent sense of virtue: that though she is often consumed with vanity as her most reliable trait, there is a clear sense here that it is merely performance to her. Her greatest interest, even long before she and Belinda are close, is that Clarence might one day serve as a suitable and loving husband to Belinda. Of important note as well is that when Lady Delacour quite literally is approaching her death bed before a risky surgery, among her wishes is that Belinda is left with some of her most expensive jewelry should she perish, explicitly stating that they are to be hers either to finance her independence, or worn with joy should she be married to ""an opulent husband"" (274).

Because Belinda is not aware of Lady Delacour's underlying machinations and the promise she made to Clarence, her conduct remains in line with prudence; reserved and distant from him despite his overt efforts to smooth things over between them. In his frustration with what appears to be Lady Delacour and Belinda refusing to fulfill their end of the agreement, he refers to the efforts of King Philip II in this play to try to subdue the tensions of war between the English and the French via the marriage between the French crown prince and King John's niece Blanche, beseeching the papal legate to support his cause in sanctifying the union and avoiding conflict: “Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed Of smiling peace, to march a bloody host, And make a riot on the gentle brow Of true sincerity? O holy Sir, My reverend Father, let it not be so; Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose, Some gentle order, and we shall be blest To do your pleasure, and continue friends"" (33). The most notable implication in this alignment suggests that Clarence perceives Belinda’s assumed displeasure with him on the same scale of a monarch wary of war looming on the horizon; while naturally Belinda is not disposed to conflict in the slightest, it does reveal the gravity with which he frets over the capacity to win her esteem. Despite his assurances that he has no interest in marriage and does not think of Belinda in that way quite yet, it is worthy of notice that he is fixated on winning her good will with surprising determination—that her cool acceptance of his presence when visiting the Delacours is insufficient to satisfy him. It is also not the only instance within the novel that he engages in some hyperbole when it comes to any sensitive territory with regard to Belinda, indicating the latent nature of his true admiration and passion for her in these sudden moments of uncharacteristic insistence.

88,kneller.jpeg,To Sir Godfrey Kneller',image/jpeg,"The original poem was dedicated to Sir Godfrey Kneller, who at the time was a famous portrait painter--known for his renderings of eminent figures like John Locke. This parallel is a rather complex one, in that Dryden was writing with something of a caustic hand towards what he considered was the decay of art (especially in its meaning) following a number of political and cultural shifts under King William's reign. The line referenced here likely conveys the sentiment that Kneller's works would stand the test of time, and would subsequently be dulled in value in the eyes of the discipline in the future (which does not actually appear to be the case, given modern fascination with his works). When taken in context, as Dr.X--'s recitation of this line is with direct reference to Lady Delacour's beauty and singular character as affirmed by Clarence despite four years elapsed since their initial acquaintance, this has significant implications. Kneller here is being accused of greater devotion to his livelihood than the impact of his work, a distinct echo of Margaret Delacour's upcoming criticism towards Lady Delacour: that she is more obsessed with the impact of her social performances than her duties as a mother and wife. Both Margaret and Dryden are revealed to be somewhat harsh and unsympathetic to their subjects of criticism, and Dr.X—’s remark here can be seen as a brilliant stroke of foreshadowing with regard to the churlish skepticism that will soon emerge in the novel. Lady Delacour is also frequently described as heavily painting her own face with make-up, and trying to conceal the very marks of age implied here—doubling the significance of this parallel as she subliminally resists Dryden’s looming portend; that should she continue in her dedication to frolic, her vain actions will not be received in the present or the future with any great alacrity.",John Dryden,"Featured on the last page of the poem, line 179.",1694,1694,Poetry,Literary Culture; Moral,https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99138106848401021,Dr. X--,87,"""'Like a true connoisseur,' said Dr.X--, 'you admire a fine picture, the older it grows--I hear that her ladyship's face is really one of the finest pieces of painting extant, with the advantage of ""Ev'ry grace which time alone can grant.""'""",,

The scene just before, for instance, features all of them becoming inebriated in the course of wine tasting--and they are so fixated on enjoying their subsequent dinner that they leave Clarence behind after a near-death experience.

The first, is that until Clarence's own full history is known later in the novel, there is an uncertainty as to the truth of his necessary absence and even his feelings for Belinda (which are later ameliorated, as Herodotus himself is taken in context as well).
