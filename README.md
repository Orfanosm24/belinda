This digital archive is fairly self-explanatory, in that it provides the basic function of exploring primary sources via the selection of relevant thumbnails, subject and author tags, a search bar (which allows for sorting based on Title, Date, Creator, Subjects, and Character Quoted), along with website navigation in the top banner. Within each thumbnail is metadata generated about the primary source and the location of its occurance within the novel. A timeline provides a glimpse into the temporal scope of this primary source corpus, all csv file data is available for perusal and download, and the about page gives a sense of the origins and aim of the project.
